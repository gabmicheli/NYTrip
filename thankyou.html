  <h1> Thank You from the Students </h1>
  
  
  <p>Dear Donors:</p>
<p> -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Thank you for making this possible. Our trip to New York was easily the most ambitious and successful field trip of our high school experience. From Harlem to Times Square, our class was given a studiously planned journey throughout the city. I have no doubt that the trip did a great deal to imprint the lessons of class into our memories and better concrete our unit on immigration and the Harlem Renaissance.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Harry Hirsch</p>

<p>Thank you donors for making this trip possible. I enjoyed every moment and truly appreciate the new experience it gave me. I don't think I have ever felt so affected after walking out of a museum or felt such a sense of community after watching a play. Being able to connect what I learned about the great migration and Immigration to America to places it actually happened in like the tenement museum and Harlem, gave me a much better grasp on what  read in a textbook and how it is in real life.</p>
  <p>Thank you very much</p>

<p>Thank you for granting the amazing opportunity of visiting the Big Apple to me and my peers! I recently went on another school trip to New York City and without the help of donors, students were unable to go on the trip, because they could not afford the cost of the trip. Thanks to you, 85 students were able to experience in person what they’ve been learning in class, which contributes massively to the learning process. Some students hadn’t even been to New York City before this trip, and because of you, they had an astounding and exciting first visit to the Big Apple! As a musical lover, I know that tickets aren’t cheap, and so I am especially grateful for the opportunity you gave us to see Come From Away. The show was fantastic! In addition, I really enjoyed going on the walking tours in Harlem and the Lower East Side, because I could imagine myself living as an immigrant or migrant, and walk around the same areas they did!</p> 

<p>This trip was truly amazing, and my peers and I are so lucky and grateful to have you as sponsors to help us take our learning to the next level, and visit New York City!</p>

<p>This trip is an experience I will never forget. Without your donations, I never would have gone to the 9/11 memorial, seen Come From Away, walked Harlem and gone up the World Trade Center. In my opinion seeing Come From Away was a priceless experience, it was a life changing show. As someone who was born after 9/11, I have seen many videos of the towers falling but watching Come From Away made me experience the raw fear and sorrow everyone felt. I am so incredibly grateful for this opportunity you provided us. We never would have gone on this trip without your donations. </p>
