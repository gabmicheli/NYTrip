  <h1> Thank You from the Teachers </h1>
  
  <p>Dear Donors:

“Kids these days…” that’s what everyone says and what they mean is that kids don’t know anything and they do crazy things. But we have just taken 90 “kids” to New York, thanks to your enormous generosity, and they have learned, listened, and absorbed one of the major cities of the world.

I do the challenging work of schooling because I believe that education is the only way “to sow seeds and grow plants.” We must continue to grow the young into people of decency, intelligence, and people with a respect for the past. On this trip, our students saw the homes of early immigrants, and one of them said, while standing in a room of 420 square feet for 7 people, “Wow, I am privileged.” This young woman comes from the southeastern section of Washington, DC, from a single mother, and from very challenging circumstances herself. While in the home of the Rosenthals, she saw that there have always been people who have struggled. She also saw that we are a country that welcomed the struggling, and she was proud of her country for that welcome.

Kids pressed against the windows of the buses and said, as they saw the Statue of Liberty,  “Wow, is that really it? Really. I wasn’t sure it actually existed.” We must continue to combat the ills of fake news and virtual reality. This trip allowed students to be in reality in one of the most real cities of the world. 

One of our African American students said, as we walked down 125th Street: “Harlem is in New York? Really?” I thought only rich people lived in New York.” Not sure you need more proof than that of what a truly profound gift you have given the students and faculty of Washington Latin Public Charter School.                       --Dr. Diana Smith, Principal
